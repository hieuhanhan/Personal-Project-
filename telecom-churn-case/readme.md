# Telecom Churn Case Study 

This project analyzes telecom customer churn using Python and machine learning techniques to uncover key drivers and improve customer retention.

## Project Structure

- `telecom-churn-case.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- `data`: 'telecom_churn_data.csv'.

- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages and versions to set up the environment.

## Key Steps

Data cleaning:  
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Corrected data types  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
- Visualized customer churn patterns  
- Identified correlations between customer demographics and churn  

Feature engineering:  
- Created new features based on usage, service type, and customer demographics  
- Standardized numerical data  

Model training and evaluation:  
- Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics  

Insights & recommendations:  
- Identified top factors driving churn  
- Proposed actionable strategies for reducing churn
