# Automatic Ticket Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to automatically classify IT support tickets based on text descriptions.

## Files
- `Case_Study_Automatic_Ticket_Classification.ipynb`: Notebook with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries.

## Key Steps
- Text cleaning and preprocessing (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
- Training a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluating model performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo and navigate to the directory.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
